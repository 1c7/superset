## Deploy
The "Deploy" chapter contain all the information you need to deploy Superset to a production environment.  

## Introduction
In this "Introduction" section,  
We focus on how to config Superset for production environment.   
We won't talk about specific Cloud Service Provider(AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc) 

## Docker
Deploy Superset using Docker are recommended.  
by using Docker, we won't need to deal with environment inconsistency problem,   
Also, when traffic grows, we can just spin up more container to handle the traffic.  
If you are not familiar with Docker, you should read [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) first.

## The Docker concept you should know before starting
* What is Docker Image? What is Docker Container? What's their difference?  
* What is `Dockerfile`?
* What is `docker build` and `docker run` commands?
* What is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)? 
* What is Docker Compose(`docker-compose.yml`)?

Tips: after installed Docker, you can run `docker --help` to show all the available Docker commands.  


## Basic: We need to build our own Docker Image
Why?  
Because there are some important configuration we need to set,  
We can't just use the Superset Docker Image from DockerHub ([`apache/superset`](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/superset)) directly.      
We need to build our own Docker Image **base on** `apache/superset`: 


## Example 1: config `APP_NAME`. 
In the first example, we want things to be as simple as possible.   
We gonna set one config called `APP_NAME` and nothing else.  
The purpose of this example is to show you how to config Superset.  

First, let's create a folder named `hello-superset` with these 2 empty files:
```
.
├── Dockerfile
└── superset_config.py
```
The content above come from the output of `tree .` command.   
the `tree` command list contents of directories in a tree-like format.    
`tree .` mean list all file in current location.    

Copy and paste the following content into `superset_config.py`:
```python
APP_NAME = "Hello Superset"  
``` 

Copy and paste the following content into `Dockerfile`:   
```Dockerfile
FROM apache/superset 

COPY superset_config.py /app/pythonpath/superset_config.py
```

Next, Let's build the Docker Image, run this command inside `hello-superset` folder:
```
docker build --tag hello-superset .
```
Explain: 
* the `.`(period) at the end of command, mean use current directory as "build context" (By default the `docker build` command will look for a `Dockerfile` at the root of the build context.)
* `--tag hello-superset` mean give this Docker Image a tag "hello-superset"

Let's show the Docker Image we just built:  
```
docker images hello-superset
```

Output:  
```
REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
hello-superset   latest    2688cfad3224   About an hour ago   1.69GB
```

We are not using `docker images ls` here, because it output all the Docker Images.  
It make our terminal messy.  


Let's run the `hello-superset` Docker Image:
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8088 --name superset-container hello-superset
```
Explain:
  * `-d` mean run this container in background. (you can replace `-d` with `--detach`)
  * `-p 8080:8088` mean bind host port 8080 to container port 8088. format is `host_port:container_port`. (you can replace `-p` with `--publish`)
  * `--name superset-container` mean give this container a name "superset-container"
  * `hello-superset` is the Docker Image name we want to run.


We can verify there are a container called `superset-container` by using `docker ps` command.
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                       PORTS                    NAMES
332421e4b621   hello-superset   "/bin/sh -c /usr/bin…"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour (healthy)   0.0.0.0:8080->8088/tcp   superset-container
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the result.

The title is `Hello Superset`,  
That mean `APP_NAME` config is working.  

## Example 2: Verify the `superset_config.py` is working.       
In the second example, we want to verify the config.  
the `APP_NAME` is easy to verify, we can just look at the title of the page.  
But there are a lot of other config are not shown on the page.  

I am gonna assume the Docker Container from Example 1 are still running, in that case,  
we can get into the container using this command:
```
docker exec -it superset-container /bin/bash
```

Now your terminal become:  
```
superset@fb91498fad65:/app$
```

Get into Flask Shell by running:  
```
flask shell
```

You would probably see these output:
```

>>> 
```

Let's read the `APP_NAME` config:  
```
>>> app.config["APP_NAME"]
'Hello Superset'
```

In the default configuration file (`superset/config.py`), you would find these lines:
```
# The SQLAlchemy connection string.
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "sqlite:///" + os.path.join(DATA_DIR, "superset.db")
```

Let's see what's the value of `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`

```
>>> app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"]
'sqlite:////app/superset_home/superset.db'
```

Done, now you know, in order to get config value, the steps are:
1. Get into the Docker Container
2. Run `flask shell`
3. Run `app.config["CONFIG_NAME"]`  

## Example 3: login Superset for the first time.  
TODO


## The 2 configuration you must set.   
1. `SECRET_KEY`: Your App secret key.
2. `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: Superset's metadata database.  

The default value of `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` is a SQLite database store on local file system,  
Because we are using Docker,
